## **A Better Approach**

## **The Absurdity of ATS Requirements**  

This document looks ridiculous because it is. The ATS-driven job application process forces candidates to replace meaningful details with buzzwords and numeric padding to “prove” value to machines. Human nuance and context are sacrificed for an algorithm's arbitrary preferences.  

ATS requirements don't exist universally—there are no published standards or transparent metrics. Most advice is speculation, shaped by expensive tools that prey on job seekers' desperation. Why not just adopt a universal format like YAML or JSON for structuring resumes? Or better yet, use generative models to create adaptive, context-aware documents that highlight real achievements without forcing candidates to reduce their worth to keywords.

## **Why Are We Stuck in This System?**  

The current reliance on ATS systems is a symptom of a deeper problem: efficiency has overtaken effectiveness in hiring. Companies prioritize speed and automation over nuance and human connection, creating a hiring pipeline that favors conformity over creativity. ATS exists not because it works well, but because it’s easy to deploy at scale. It’s a shortcut—one that turns applicants into data points and encourages recruiters to focus on scores instead of people.

But here’s the kicker: **ATS doesn’t even solve the problem it was created for.** By filtering out resumes that don’t meet arbitrary criteria, these systems often eliminate highly qualified candidates before a human ever sees their application. Instead of creating a fair and effective process, ATS systems shift the burden onto applicants, requiring them to jump through hoops, use secret keywords, and rewrite their resumes for every single job posting.  

## **The Human Cost of Automation**  

Let’s consider the actual toll this takes. For a mid-level professional with a decade of experience, rewriting a resume to fit ATS requirements for a dozen job postings can take hours—if not days—of unpaid labor. That’s time that could have been spent refining their craft, learning new skills, or networking in meaningful ways. Instead, they’re forced to reverse-engineer a broken system in the hopes of making it past the first digital gatekeeper.  

And what about the emotional cost? Imagine being a senior botanist who’s dedicated years to researching endangered species, only to have your resume flagged as “irrelevant” because you didn’t include the exact phrasing of “leveraged cross-disciplinary methodologies to optimize biodiversity outcomes.” The system doesn’t care about your expertise or passion; it cares about its own rules.

## **What’s the Alternative?**  

If the goal is to streamline hiring, let’s start by rethinking the tools we use. Here’s what a better system could look like:  

1. **Standardized Resume Formats**  
   - Adopt a universal structure like YAML, JSON, or XML for resumes, allowing applicants to store their data in a reusable, machine-readable format.  
   - This removes the need for constant rewriting and lets ATS systems focus on actual qualifications, not formatting quirks.  

2. **Generative Models for Customization**  
   - Use generative AI to adapt standardized resumes to specific roles, highlighting relevant experience without requiring applicants to do all the heavy lifting.  
   - This would allow candidates to focus on presenting their authentic selves, while AI handles the keyword game.  

3. **Human-Centered Hiring**  
   - Prioritize systems that enhance human decision-making rather than replacing it. Recruiters should use technology as a tool to sort *and* understand candidates, not as a crutch to avoid reading resumes.  
   - For example, AI could summarize applicant profiles instead of filtering them out, ensuring that no one is dismissed without consideration.  

4. **Expand the Definition of Value**  
   - Move beyond metrics and buzzwords to recognize intangible contributions like mentorship, creativity, and collaboration. These are the qualities that make teams successful, but they rarely show up in ATS-friendly formats.  

5. **Encourage Honest Applications**  
   - Redesign hiring systems to reward clarity and honesty, rather than forcing candidates to inflate their achievements or twist their experiences into meaningless metrics.  

## **Reclaiming the Narrative**  

The problem isn’t just with the tools—it’s with the culture surrounding them. Hiring practices have become so focused on efficiency that they’ve lost sight of the purpose: finding the right person for the job. To fix this, we need to shift the narrative around resumes, interviews, and candidate evaluation.  

Let’s stop pretending that resumes are scientific documents, capable of objectively proving someone’s worth. They’re stories. They’re snapshots of a person’s journey, their skills, their growth, and their potential. And stories don’t need metrics to be compelling—they need humanity.  

## **A Call to Action**  

It’s time to demand better from the hiring process. As candidates, recruiters, and employers, we need to recognize the limitations of ATS systems and push for alternatives that prioritize people over algorithms.  

If you’re a job seeker, write your resume for humans, not machines. Speak clearly about your work, your passions, and your goals. Let your voice shine through, even if it means risking rejection by an ATS.  

If you’re a recruiter, question the tools you rely on. Take the time to read resumes and connect with candidates directly. Remember that no algorithm can replace the insights you gain from a conversation.  

And if you’re an employer, invest in systems that reflect your values. Create hiring processes that honor the complexity and individuality of your candidates. After all, the best people aren’t always the ones with the perfect score—they’re the ones who bring something unique to the table.  

**The Future of Hiring**  

Imagine a world where resumes don’t have to conform to arbitrary rules, where applicants are evaluated on their skills and potential instead of their ability to game a system. This isn’t just a dream—it’s a possibility.  

But to make it happen, we need to stop accepting the status quo. We need to challenge the idea that hiring has to be a numbers game. And we need to reclaim the resume as a document of humanity, creativity, and purpose.  

Because at the end of the day, hiring isn’t about buzzwords or metrics. It’s about people. Let’s build systems that remember that.
