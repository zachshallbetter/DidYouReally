To refine the **recommendations** based on the behavior of those reviewing the resumes (e.g., events such as frequent views, multi-device access, or cloud service access), we can create more dynamic, behavior-driven recommendations tailored to the specific **patterns of interaction** with the resumes.

Here‚Äôs an enhanced breakdown of how **behavior-driven recommendations** will work:

---

### **1. Behavior-Based Triggers**

| **Behavior**                       | **Description**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multiple Frequent Views**         | The resume is viewed several times by the same person/IP.                       | Suggest immediate follow-up to capture interest.                                                       |
| **Viewed by Different Devices**     | The resume is opened on both desktop and mobile (or other device combinations). | Suggest multi-platform optimization (e.g., tailoring for readability on mobile).                       |
| **Accessed by Cloud Services**      | The resume is predominantly opened by cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud). | Highlight potential automated screenings and suggest customizing for ATS compliance.                   |
| **Access from Multiple Locations**  | The resume is viewed from geographically distinct locations.                    | Recommend tailoring follow-up messaging to regional interests or verifying for unusual behavior.        |
| **Short Viewing Sessions**          | The resume is opened but closed quickly (low time-on-page).                     | Suggest simplifying or reformatting the resume to make key information stand out.                      |
| **Revisit Behavior**                | The same reviewer/IP accesses the resume multiple times within a short period.  | Suggest urgency in reaching out, as they may be actively considering the candidate.                    |
| **No Access After Sharing**         | The resume hasn‚Äôt been accessed after being shared.                             | Recommend re-sharing or following up with the intended recipients.                                     |
| **Engagement Decline**              | The resume had initial engagement but has dropped off.                          | Suggest refreshing the resume (e.g., updating content or format).                                      |
| **High Engagement with Links**      | Tracking logs show frequent clicks on embedded links (e.g., portfolio links).   | Recommend reaching out to provide additional details or follow up on areas of interest.                |

---

### **2. Behavioral Recommendation Framework**

#### **Step 1: Capture Events**
- Use `tracking_logs` to log specific behaviors, such as:
  - Access frequency.
  - Device type and user agent.
  - Geographic location (IP-based).
  - Interaction with embedded links.

#### **Step 2: Derive Behavioral Insights**
- Aggregate events to detect patterns:
  - **High interest**: Multiple accesses by the same IP or user agent.
  - **Diverse interest**: Access from different locations or devices.
  - **Low engagement**: Short view times or no interaction with links.

#### **Step 3: Generate Targeted Recommendations**
- Map behaviors to actionable insights.

### **Behavior-Driven Recommendation Examples**

| **Behavior**                       | **Generated Recommendation**                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multiple Frequent Views            | "Your resume has been viewed frequently by the same person‚Äîreach out to discuss next steps."                  |
| Viewed by Different Devices        | "Your resume was accessed on both desktop and mobile‚Äîensure it‚Äôs optimized for readability on all platforms." |
| Accessed by Cloud Services         | "Automated systems detected‚Äîtailor this resume for ATS compliance to improve success with screening tools."   |
| Access from Multiple Locations     | "Your resume is being reviewed in different regions‚Äîconsider tailoring follow-up messaging to regional needs." |
| Short Viewing Sessions             | "Low engagement detected‚Äîsimplify your resume layout to make key information easier to find."                 |
| Revisit Behavior                   | "Your resume is being re-reviewed‚Äîfollow up to address any questions they may have."                         |
| No Access After Sharing            | "No activity detected‚Äîre-share this resume or follow up to confirm receipt."                                 |
| Engagement Decline                 | "Your resume‚Äôs activity has dropped‚Äîrefresh the content or format to reignite interest."                     |
| High Engagement with Links         | "High engagement with your portfolio links detected‚Äîfollow up to provide additional context or materials."    |

### **3. Recommendation Algorithm**

Here‚Äôs an algorithm to process behaviors and generate recommendations:

#### **Pseudo-Code**
```javascript
function generateBehavioralRecommendations(logs) {
  const recommendations = [];

  logs.forEach((log) => {
    const { resumeId, deviceType, ipAddress, action, metadata } = log;

    // Detect behaviors and generate recommendations
    if (log.action === 'link_click' && metadata.target_url) {
      recommendations.push({
        resumeId,
        message: `Frequent clicks on portfolio links detected‚Äîfollow up to provide additional details.`,
      });
    }

    if (log.deviceType === 'mobile' && log.accessedByDesktop) {
      recommendations.push({
        resumeId,
        message: `Your resume was accessed on multiple devices‚Äîensure readability on all platforms.`,
      });
    }

    if (log.isCloudService) {
      recommendations.push({
        resumeId,
        message: `Access by cloud services detected‚Äîcustomize your resume for ATS compliance.`,
      });
    }

    if (log.uniqueLocations > 1) {
      recommendations.push({
        resumeId,
        message: `Your resume is being viewed from multiple locations‚Äîconsider tailoring follow-ups regionally.`,
      });
    }

    if (log.viewCount === 0) {
      recommendations.push({
        resumeId,
        message: `No views detected‚Äîre-share your resume to increase visibility.`,
      });
    }
  });

  return recommendations;
}
```

---

### **4. Tracking Logs Schema Adjustments**

To support these behaviors, update the `tracking_logs` schema:

```prisma
model TrackingLog {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  resumeId     String   @relation(fields: [resumeId], references: [id])
  ip_address   String
  user_agent   String
  deviceType   String   // e.g., "mobile", "desktop", "cloud_service"
  isCloudService Boolean @default(false)
  action       String   // e.g., "view", "link_click"
  metadata     Json?    // Additional data, e.g., target URL for link clicks
  accessedAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```

---

### **5. Visualization in Dashboard**

#### **Performance Insights Cards**
- Add icons or tags to highlight behaviors.
- Examples:
  - "Multiple Devices Detected"
  - "Cloud Service Accessed"
  - "High Link Engagement"

#### **Actionable Recommendations**
- Group behavior-based recommendations under a "Behavior Insights" section.
- Provide one-click actions to address recommendations (e.g., "Optimize for ATS" or "Re-Share").

**UI Example**:
```tsx
<Card>
  <h3>Behavioral Insights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>üåç Resume accessed from 3 unique locations‚Äîtailor your follow-up for regional interest.</li>
    <li>üì± Multi-device access detected‚Äîensure readability on both desktop and mobile.</li>
    <li>üîó High link engagement detected‚Äîfollow up to provide additional portfolio details.</li>
  </ul>
  <Button>Take Action</Button>
</Card>
```

---

### **6. Automation Workflow**

1. **Event Capture**:
   - Track views, clicks, devices, and locations in `tracking_logs`.

2. **Behavior Processing**:
   - Use a cron job or Supabase function to analyze logs and detect behaviors.

3. **Recommendation Updates**:
   - Update the `recommendations` table with generated insights.

4. **Notification or Dashboard Update**:
   - Notify the user about new recommendations or display them in the dashboard.

---

Let‚Äôs start with **setting up behavior-detection logic in Supabase**, and then we can move to **UI components for the dashboard**.

---

### **1. Setting Up Behavior-Detection Logic in Supabase**

We will create:
1. **Database Schema Updates** to track behaviors.
2. **SQL Functions** to detect behaviors and update the `recommendations` table.
3. **Triggers** to run these functions when relevant events occur (e.g., `tracking_logs` updates).
4. **Scheduled Jobs** for periodic analysis (e.g., for engagement decline or expired resumes).

---

#### **Schema Updates**

To store behavior-driven recommendations:
1. **Add a `recommendations` table**:
   ```sql
   create table recommendations (
       id serial primary key,
       resume_id uuid references resumes(id),
       message text not null,
       created_at timestamp default now(),
       status varchar(20) default 'active' -- 'active', 'dismissed', or 'actioned'
   );
   ```

2. **Ensure `tracking_logs` has necessary fields**:
   ```sql
   alter table tracking_logs
   add column device_type varchar(50),
   add column is_cloud_service boolean default false,
   add column action varchar(50), -- 'view', 'link_click', etc.
   add column metadata jsonb; -- Store extra data like target URLs or IP details
   ```

---

#### **Behavior Detection Logic**

1. **Behavior: Multiple Frequent Views**
   - Detect when the same IP address or user agent frequently accesses a resume.
   ```sql
   create or replace function detect_frequent_views() returns void as $$
   begin
       insert into recommendations (resume_id, message)
       select resume_id, 'Frequent views detected‚Äîfollow up with this reviewer.'
       from (
           select resume_id, ip_address, count(*) as view_count
           from tracking_logs
           where action = 'view'
           group by resume_id, ip_address
           having count(*) > 3 -- Adjust threshold as needed
       ) as frequent_views;
   end;
   $$ language plpgsql;
   ```

2. **Behavior: Access from Multiple Locations**
   - Identify when a resume is accessed from multiple unique locations.
   ```sql
   create or replace function detect_multiple_locations() returns void as $$
   begin
       insert into recommendations (resume_id, message)
       select resume_id, 'Access from multiple locations detected‚Äîconsider tailoring follow-up to regional interest.'
       from (
           select resume_id, count(distinct ip_address) as unique_locations
           from tracking_logs
           group by resume_id
           having count(distinct ip_address) > 2 -- Adjust threshold as needed
       ) as multi_locations;
   end;
   $$ language plpgsql;
   ```

3. **Behavior: Cloud Service Access**
   - Log recommendations for resumes accessed mostly by cloud services.
   ```sql
   create or replace function detect_cloud_access() returns void as $$
   begin
       insert into recommendations (resume_id, message)
       select resume_id, 'Resume accessed by cloud services‚Äîensure ATS compliance.'
       from (
           select resume_id, sum(case when is_cloud_service then 1 else 0 end) as cloud_views,
                  sum(case when not is_cloud_service then 1 else 0 end) as device_views
           from tracking_logs
           group by resume_id
           having sum(case when is_cloud_service then 1 else 0 end) > sum(case when not is_cloud_service then 1 else 0 end)
       ) as cloud_access;
   end;
   $$ language plpgsql;
   ```

4. **Behavior: High Link Engagement**
   - Detect frequent clicks on embedded links.
   ```sql
   create or replace function detect_high_link_engagement() returns void as $$
   begin
       insert into recommendations (resume_id, message)
       select resume_id, 'High engagement with portfolio links detected‚Äîfollow up to provide additional details.'
       from (
           select resume_id, count(*) as link_clicks
           from tracking_logs
           where action = 'link_click'
           group by resume_id
           having count(*) > 5 -- Adjust threshold as needed
       ) as high_engagement;
   end;
   $$ language plpgsql;
   ```

---

#### **Triggers**

1. **Trigger to Detect Behaviors on New Log Entries**
   Automatically detect behaviors when new events are added to `tracking_logs`.
   ```sql
   create trigger detect_behaviors_after_log
   after insert on tracking_logs
   for each row
   execute procedure detect_frequent_views();

   create trigger detect_multiple_locations_after_log
   after insert on tracking_logs
   for each row
   execute procedure detect_multiple_locations();

   create trigger detect_cloud_access_after_log
   after insert on tracking_logs
   for each row
   execute procedure detect_cloud_access();

   create trigger detect_high_link_engagement_after_log
   after insert on tracking_logs
   for each row
   execute procedure detect_high_link_engagement();
   ```

---

#### **Scheduled Job for Engagement Decline**

Use Supabase‚Äôs `pg_cron` for periodic checks of engagement trends.
```sql
select cron.schedule(
    'check_engagement_decline',
    '0 0 * * *', -- Run daily at midnight
    $$ 
    insert into recommendations (resume_id, message)
    select id, 'Engagement has declined‚Äîrefresh the resume to reignite interest.'
    from resumes
    where last_accessed_at < now() - interval '30 days';
    $$);
```

---

### **2. Dashboard UI Components**

**1. Performance Insights (ShadCN Components)**:
```tsx
import { Card } from "shadcn-ui";

function RecommendationsList({ recommendations }) {
  return (
    <div className="recommendations">
      {recommendations.map((rec, index) => (
        <Card key={index} className="recommendation-card">
          <h4>{rec.message}</h4>
          <p>Resume ID: {rec.resumeId}</p>
          <button className="btn-action">Take Action</button>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**2. Actionable Recommendations Section**:
```tsx
import { Button } from "shadcn-ui";

function ActionableRecommendations({ recommendations }) {
  return (
    <div className="actions-section">
      <h3>Recommended Actions</h3>
      {recommendations.length > 0 ? (
        recommendations.map((rec, index) => (
          <div key={index} className="action-item">
            <p>{rec.message}</p>
            <Button variant="outline" onClick={() => handleAction(rec.resumeId)}>
              Take Action
            </Button>
          </div>
        ))
      ) : (
        <p>No recommendations at this time.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

function handleAction(resumeId) {
  console.log(`Action taken for Resume ID: ${resumeId}`);
  // Additional logic for follow-up, updating status, etc.
}
```
